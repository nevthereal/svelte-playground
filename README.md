# SvelteKit Playground

## About this repository

This repository is just a playground, where I try to build a few things with Svelte.
First of all, I do this after a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mUGqExgPdQ). I plan to add some more things to this project and overall just experiment with different libraries to discover SvelteKit.

## Tech stack

### Current:

- SvelteKit
- Skeleton UI
- Vite
- Stripe

### Interests:

- Drizzle ORM
- Supabase or some other db
- Some animation Library

## Takeaways

There have been a few differences between React and Svelte, which is exactly why I am trying this out. I am happy, that it is not something entirely new, because I still can use Vite and it's handy functions, so the environment is about the same. I really like the syntax and that I can write pure HTML instead of JSX syntax. I also really like the router. In React, I had to install an extra library for routing, compared to here, where I can just use the folder structure for routing. I need to work a bit more with this, but until now, my impression is pretty good.
